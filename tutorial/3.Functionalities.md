# Part 3: Functionalities

**xtreamPOC** includes several functionalities that enhance the viewing experience: **Replay**, **Record**, and **Frequent Search**. These features ensure seamless streaming, the ability to save content, and quick access to commonly searched terms.

## 1. Replay

The **Replay** functionality is designed for live channels only. It is useful in cases where a stream might be unstable or experience interruptions.

- **Purpose**: Automatically restarts the stream if it stops unexpectedly.
- **How to Use**: Enable the "Replay" switch to activate this feature. When active, xtreamPOC will continuously attempt to replay the stream if it encounters interruptions.
- **Note**: The Replay function will remain active until you manually disable the "Replay" switch.

## 2. Record

The **Record** functionality allows you to record any type of stream, including live channels, movies, and series.

- **Purpose**: Save content for later viewing by recording the stream directly to your configured directory.
- **How to Use**: Enable the "Record" checkbox before streaming. This will start recording the content when played. If the stream stops unexpectedly and "Replay" is also enabled, xtreamPOC will restart the stream and continue recording.
- **Saved Files**: Recordings are saved in the path specified in the `xtreamPOC.json` configuration file. Use `mpv_rec_win` for Windows and `mpv_rec_linux` for Linux to set your recording directory.

## 3. Frequent Search

The **Frequent Search** functionality simplifies access to commonly searched terms by allowing users to quickly reselect previously used search queries.

- **Purpose**: Automatically adds frequently searched terms (searched three times or more) to a dropdown list for easy access.
- **How it Works**:
  - When you search for a specific term three times or more, it is added to the **Frequent Search** dropdown list.
  - To search for a term from this list, click the dropdown arrow and select the desired search term.
- **Usage Tips**: This feature is especially useful for terms you search for regularly, like favorite series, movies, or channels. You can quickly access them from the dropdown without retyping.

These features work together to make xtreamPOC a more user-friendly tool. **Replay** and **Record** provide control over streaming reliability and recording, while **Frequent Search** streamlines access to popular search terms.
